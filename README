Obtain the code from the bitbucket repository with:

git clone https://bitbucket.org/jeremy_mcrae/de_novo_clustering.git

The code depends on a python module (requests), which can be installed with:

pip install --user requests 
# or python3 -m pip install --user requests

Then you can shift to the code folder, and analyse with:
cd  de_novo_clustering/

python clustering.py \
   --in data/example_de_novos.txt \
   --rates data/forSanger_1KG_mutation_rate_table.txt \
   --deprecated-genes data/deprecated_ddg2p_hgnc_ids.txt \
   --out test.txt

That command uses a minimal example de novo input file, included in the git 
repository. The input is a tab-separated file with a line for each de novo 
event. The columns are HGNC symbol, chromosome, position, VEP consequence for 
the variant, and whether the de novo is a SNP or indel (the analysis excludes 
indels). 

The deprecated gene ID file is a manually generated file for the genes where 
the code failed to retrieve coordinates from Ensembl, so it's built from the 
gene symbols from analysed files to date, so ongoing analyses might pick up 
additional genes with out of date gene symbols.
