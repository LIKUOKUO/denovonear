## Denovonear

This code assesses whether recurrent de novo single-nucleotide variants lie
closer together within the coding sequence of a gene than expected by chance.
We use mutation rates based on the local sequence context to determine the
expected likelihood that specific regions of the gene contain mutations.
Currently, the local sequence context mutation rates are per-trinucleotide
mutation rates provided by Kaitlin Samocha of the Broad Institute, see [Nature
Genetics 46:944â€“950](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v46/n9/full/ng.3050.html),
but you can use your own rates, or even longer sequence contexts, such as 5-mers
or 7-mers.

Obtain the code from the repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/jeremymcrae/denovonear.git`

Then you can shift to the code folder, and set up the code with:
```sh
cd  denovonear/
python setup.py install --user
```

### Analysis
Analyse your de novos with:
```sh
python scripts/clustering.py \
   --in data/example_de_novos.txt \
   --rates data/forSanger_1KG_mutation_rate_table.txt \
   --out output.txt
```

That command uses a minimal example de novo input file, included in the git
repository. The input is a tab-separated file with a line for each de novo
event. The columns are HGNC symbol, chromosome, position, VEP consequence for
the variant, and whether the de novo is a SNP or indel (the analysis excludes
indels).

Other options are:
 * `--deprecated-genes data/deprecated_ddg2p_hgnc_ids.txt`
 * `--cache-folder PATH_TO_CACHE_DIR`
 * `--genome-build "grch37" or "grch38" (default=grch37)`

The deprecated gene ID file is a manually generated file for the genes where
the code failed to retrieve coordinates from Ensembl, so it's built from the
gene symbols from analysed files to date, so ongoing analyses might pick up
additional genes with out of date gene symbols.

The cache folder defaults to making a folder named "cache" within the working
directory. The genome build indicates which genome build the coordinates of the
de novo variants are based on, and defaults to GRCh37.

#### Identify transcripts containing de novo events
You can identify transcripts containing de novos events with the
`identify_transcripts.py` script. This either identifies all transcripts for a
gene with one or more de novo events, or identifies the minimal set of
transcripts to contain all de novos (where transcripts are prioritised on the
basis of number of de novo events, and length of coding sequence). Transcripts
can be identified with:
```sh
python scripts/identify_transcripts.py \
    --de-novos data/example_de_novos.txt \
    --out output.txt \
    --all-transcripts
```
Other options are:
 * `--minimise-transcripts` in place of `--all-transcripts`, to find the minimal
   set of transcripts
 * `--genome-build "grch37" or "grch38" (default=grch37)`

#### Gene or transcript based mutation rates
You can generate mutation rates for either the union of alternative transcripts
for a gene, or for a specific Ensembl transcript ID with the
`construct_mutation_rates.py` script. Lof and missense mutation rates can be
generated with:
```sh
python scripts/construct_mutation_rates.py \
    --transcripts data/example_transcript_ids.txt \
    --rates data/forSanger_1KG_mutation_rate_table.txt \
    --out output.txt
```
Other options are:
 * `--genes` in place of `--transcripts`, to obtain a mutation rate from the
   union of alternative transcripts for a gene. Requires a file listing HGNC
   symbols, with one or more transcript IDs per gene. The tab-separated input
   format is gene symbol followed by transcript ID. Alternative transcripts are
   listed on separate lines.

The tab-separated output file will contain one row per gene/transcript, with
each line containing a transcript ID or gene symbol, a log10 transformed
missense mutation rate, a log10 transformed nonsense mutation rate, and a log10
transformed synonymous mutation rate.
